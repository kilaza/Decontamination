# Decontamination
This script show how to decontaminate biological sequences from contaminant OTUs sequences
Since sample collection, DNA isolation and purification are associated with possible introduction of contaminant DNA apart from that intended in collected samples, it is important to remove any possible contaminant to retain a true representation of the sampled site.
Possible contaminants are sampling containers /vials, sampling reagents, DNA isolation reagents, Scientist/technician and lab environments.
